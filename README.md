## Kerbal Space Program OST

Thanks to [DerPopo](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE) and his awesome unity asset extractor, the ability to access the original uncompressed versions of the games awesome music and soundeffects was no longer a issue.

While there are a few mp3 soundtracks out there where people have constructed their own version of a "OST", this is fine, but some of us want the WAV files that give us the true spacious experience kerbal gives everyone.

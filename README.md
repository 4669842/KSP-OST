## Kerbal Space Program OST

Thanks to [DerPopo](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE) and his awesome unity asset extractor, the ability to access the original uncompressed versions of the games awesome music and sound effects was no longer a issue.

While on the web is hosted a few mp3 soundtracks constructed by other fans who want to have a OST of sorts, this is fine, but some of us want the WAV files that give us the true spacious experience kerbal gives everyone that MP3 files just cant provide.
